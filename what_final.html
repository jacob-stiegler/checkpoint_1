            Universal design is the practice of creating products, environments, and interfaces
            that work for the widest range of people without needing special adaptations.
            On the web, it means planning for different abilities, devices, languages, and
            environments instead of assuming one “typical” user.

          <h3>Key Ideas for the Web</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Interfaces should be understandable without special training.</li>
            <li>Users should have more than one way to access important content or actions.</li>
            <li>Information should be perceivable through different senses where possible.</li>
            <li>Design should reduce the impact of mistakes and make recovery simple.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Diverse Web Users</h3>
          <p>
            Web audiences include people with visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive disabilities,
            older adults, multilingual users, and people using older devices or shared computers.
            They may browse with a mouse, keyboard, touch screen, or assistive technology.

          <h3>Foundational Design Concepts</h3>
          <p>
            Concepts like layout, visual hierarchy, and affordances shape how people read and
            interact with a page. Clear grouping and descriptive headings help users find what
            they need quickly, whether they are scanning visually or jumping between headings
            with a screen reader.

          <h3>Information Architecture</h3>
          <p>
            Information architecture is the way content is organized and labeled across a site.
            Good IA makes it easy to understand where you are, where you can go, and how to get
            back. It supports search, navigation, and mental models of the site.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Assistive Technologies</h3>
          <p>
            Screen readers, screen magnifiers, and voice-control tools interpret content
            differently than a traditional browser and mouse. Universal design supports these
            tools by using meaningful HTML elements, text alternatives for images, and labels
            that clearly describe form fields and controls.
