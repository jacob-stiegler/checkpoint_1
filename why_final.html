          <h2 class="sr-only">Intro</h2>
          <p>
            The web is used for school, work, banking, health care, and staying in touch.
            When a site is hard to use, people can be shut out of important information
            and opportunities. Universal design starts from the idea that digital spaces
            should be usable by as many people as possible.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h3>Universal Design Helps Everyone</h3>
          <p>
            Universal design is not only about disability. Clear structure, readable text,
            and predictable navigation support new users, experienced users, and people
            with different abilities at the same time. When a page is easier to understand,
            everyone benefits.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Who Benefits?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>People with disabilities using screen readers, captions, or magnifiers.</li>
            <li>Mobile users on small touch screens in changing environments.</li>
            <li>People with slow or unstable internet connections.</li>
            <li>Older adults who may need larger text and simple layouts.</li>
            <li>Anyone trying to complete tasks quickly and with less frustration.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Ethics and Fairness</h3>
          <p>
            Accessibility is also an ethical issue. A student may not be able to submit
            assignments, a job seeker may be unable to apply for a position, or a patient
            may not access medical information if a site is not designed with them in mind.
            Universal design supports equal access instead of leaving people out.
          </p>

          <h3>Usability and Universal Design</h3>
          <p>
            Many universal design choices overlap with basic usability:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Headings that describe each section of the page.</li>
            <li>Navigation that stays consistent across pages.</li>
            <li>Links that clearly state where they go.</li>
            <li>Forms with clear labels and useful error messages.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            These patterns make pages easier to scan, understand, and use for everyone.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Standards and Testing</h3>
          <p>
            Web standards and accessibility guidelines provide a shared baseline for quality.
            Automated tools, keyboard-only testing, and screen reader checks help find problems
            that might be invisible to sighted developers. Testing reminds us that real people
            with different setups and needs will rely on the site.
